# Lab Guide: Password Cracking with John the Ripper

## 1. Introduction
In this lab, we will explore the world of password cracking using John the Ripper. We will learn about hashing, decrypting zip files, and much more.

### Objectives of the Lab
- Understand the basics of password cracking and hashing.
- Learn how to use John the Ripper for various tasks.

## 2. Background

In the realm of cybersecurity, password cracking and hashing are two fundamental concepts. Password cracking is the process of guessing or recovering a password from stored locations or from data transmission systems. It is used to gain unauthorized access to systems. Hashing, on the other hand, is a method of cryptography that converts any form of data into a unique strings. Any slight change in this data will change the hash string.

John the Ripper is a popular password cracking tool widely used by cybersecurity professionals. It is designed to be both feature-rich and fast. This lab will provide hands-on experience with John the Ripper, demonstrating its capabilities and usage in various scenarios. The knowledge gained will be valuable for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different password policies, and how to strengthen system security.

## 3. Pre-Lab Knowledge Check
Before we begin, let's ensure we understand the following concepts:
1. **Password Cracking**: It's the process of recovering passwords from data stored in or transmitted by a computer system.
2. **Hashing**: It's the process of converting data into a fixed-length string of letters and numbers.
3. **Types of Hashes**: These are different algorithms used to create hash values, common ones include MD5, SHA-2 and CRC32.
4. **Salts**: These are random data that's used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase.

## 4. Safety and Ethics 

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. This lab is for educational purposes only. Always respect privacy and consent when using these skills. It's crucial to understand that misuse of these skills can lead to serious consequences. Therefore, let's ensure we use our knowledge ethically and responsibly, promoting a safer digital world.
